                        format for its group stage playoff, the first match day has concluded and with an extra day of matches.
                         Usually a 2 day tues-wends matchdays were the stadard since its begining but president of uefa saw that with 
                         the england league making large tv revenue due to its USA and peacock streaming veiws left the premire league 
                         with an advantage to buy more and increase salery cap. but with uefa and fifa trying to play catch up with more
                          international breaks and longer matchdays already clubs have been seen having to rotate their starting players
                           due to hamstring overloads to acl tears. Its only been a month and the best player in the world of futball kilian
                            mbappe has been repoted to miss 5 games due to being over worked, yet the 25 yr old has proven to have one of the strongest bodies and past medicals in pre season with no muscle fatige it shows how much these players are being worked. "they are still human" a repoter/formaer goalkeeper said on espn now when they discussed their points in a lastest video.</P>
